🚀 AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Visualizer 

An interactive desktop visualization of six fundamental Uninformed Search Algorithms implemented in Python using Matplotlib.

This project demonstrates how different blind search strategies explore a structured grid environment to reach a goal state from a start state.

🎯 Project Overview

The system simulates a grid-based search problem where:

🟢 A Start Node must reach

🔴 A Goal Node

⚫ While avoiding structured obstacle walls

The application visually animates:

Frontier expansion

Explored nodes

Final path construction

Execution time per algorithm

Each traversal dynamically displays the algorithm name in the window title:

GOOD PERFORMANCE TIME APP — BFS
🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Algorithm	Optimal	Complete	Memory Usage

Breadth-First Search (BFS)	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	High

Depth-First Search (DFS)	❌ No	❌ Not always	Low

Uniform Cost Search (UCS)	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	High

Depth-Limited Search (DLS)	❌ Depends	❌ Depends	Low

Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Moderate

Bidirectional Search	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Reduced

⚙ Customization
Change Start and Goal Location

Modify these lines in the code:

START = (1, 1)
TARGET = (18, 18)
Adjust Animation Speed
DELAY = 0.05

Lower value → faster
Higher value → slower
